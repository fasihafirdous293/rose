    <p class="rose">
      A rose is either a <b>woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa </b> , in the <i>family Rosaceae  or the flower it bears</i>. There are over <u>three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars</u>.[citation needed] They form a group of plants that can be erect <i>shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles</i>.[3] Their flowers <b>vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds</b>. Most species are native to <mark>Asia</mark>, with smaller numbers native to <mark>Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa</mark>.[3] <b>Species, cultivars and hybrids</b> are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from<i> compact, miniature roses, to climbers</i> that can reach seven meters in height.[3] Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the <b>development of the wide range of garden roses.</b>
